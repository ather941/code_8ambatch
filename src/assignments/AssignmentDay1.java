	 Java Setup :

			1) Latest Version of Java - Java SE 14.0.1 is the latest release of Java SE Platform. 
			
			2) Basic Folder after Java installation - JDK & JRE
			
			3) When Java created and by whom - Java was started as a project called "Oak" by James Gosling in June 1991.
			                                   Gosling's goals were to implement a virtual machine and a language that had
			                                   a familiar C-like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. 
			                                   The first public implementation was Java 1.0 in 1995.
			
			4) Application in bin folder of Java Setup -  Applet viewer , jconsole , java compiler , java doc ,
			 											  multiple package to support java inbuilt clasees
			
			5) WORA - write once run anywhere (Adavntages of java platform independent)
			
			6) Java Installation Issues Log : No Issues observed - steps followed
										1) Downloaded Java SE 8 
										2) Setting Java Path till JDK as JAVA_HOME - Environment Variable
										3) Configuring bin folder followed by JAVA_HOME Variable
										4) After setting variable run to check the version and JRE version

			Java Architecture :
			
			1) Diff between JDK,JRE & JVM
			https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-jdk-jre-jvm.html#:~:text=JDK%20is%20a%20software%20development%20kit%20whereas%20JRE%20is%20a,JVM%20is%20Java%20Virtual%20Machine.

			2) Why Java is platform Independent - WORA
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-platform-independent/
			In the case of Java, it is the magic of Bytecode that makes it platform independent.
			
			3) Model Assignment - Hello
			
			4) How to run java command using -xms and -xmx
			
			C:\Users\abhis\AutomationLearning\workspace\Parctice_Day_Wise\Day_1
			java -Xms256m -Xmx512m -cp "C:\Users\abhis\AutomationLearning\workspace\Parctice_Day_Wise\Day_1" Test
			
			5) Can we run without name java file using cmd
			we can compile but not run because for run we don't pass any filetype/extension -just class name used to run the file
			
			6) Is Java file executable if file name is not simillar to class present in it?
			we can complie but it will throw error at runtime
			C:\Users\abhis\AutomationLearning\workspace\Parctice_Day_Wise\Day_1>javac Test.java
			
			C:\Users\abhis\AutomationLearning\workspace\Parctice_Day_Wise\Day_1>java Test
			Error: Could not find or load main class Test
